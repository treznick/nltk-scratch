# How to use virtualenvwrapper

`workon cc-nltk` or whatever you've named your virtualenv in your `.venv` file

This will:
  1. cd into your project directory
  2. activate your virtualenv
  3. install all of your requirements if they're not already there

When you're done working on that project, run `deactivate`
